## 1. Objective
This project aims to develop a **handwritten digit classifier** on [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

2. ## Dataset
MNIST contains 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits: 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. 
2.1 ### Requirments 
- **PyTorch** - 'pytorch' is an open source machine learning framework that provides an easy implementation to download the cleaned and already prepared data.
- **TorchVision** - 'torchvision' package (part of the PyTorch project) consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision.
